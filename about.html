    <h2>About House Meowzers Rescue</h2>
    <p>
      House Meowzers is a nonprofit feline rescue based in Phoenix, Arizona.  
      Our mission is to save the lives of abandoned, homeless, and at-risk cats
      through compassionate care, medical treatment, and adoption into loving homes.  
    </p>

    <p>
      Since our founding, we have provided shelter, vaccinations, spay/neuter
      services, and adoption support to countless cats. Our dedicated volunteers
      and foster families make it possible for us to continue this mission.  
    </p>

    <p>
      We believe every cat deserves a chance at a healthy, happy life.  
      With your support, we can rescue more cats and connect them with their forever families.
    </p>
